The square reader magstripe is a small box that is connected to your phone by
using the headset jack and an app that you have to download to be able to use it. This
innovation allows you to make transactions with a swipe of your card. A square reader
magstripe is affordable, you can even get one for free on there website. The purpose of
the square reader magstripe is to allow people to accept credit card payments. My
artifact shows that the main use for the magstripe reader is to allow people to make
make transaction through their phones.</p>

I created this artifact by using gimp ang google. The program I used to create my
artifact is gimp. It allows my use use images from google and put them together to

The square reader is beneficial because you can easily go to the square reader
website, make an account and get one shipped for free(2). On the other hand, this
innovation is harmful when The square reader magstripe is known to be easily
compromised. It has been explained that your magstripe credit card can be physically
record and used again without your approval(7). The impact this has is on economy
because it is really easy to afford and setup which encourages people to start small
business which means people will be exchanging more money.

The data my innovation uses is a magnetic stripe of a credit card that holds three
tracks of data, the first and second track holds the personal information of the account
holder, the third track can holds any extra information(4). This data is important
because each time you swipe your card on a square reader its process your personal
account information to make a transaction. A data security concern is when the square
reader is compromised and your credit card number can be copied and sent to a hacker
to make fraudulent charges.</p>
