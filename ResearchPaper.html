 <p>Gene therapy cures disease like birth defects, uncured chronic illnesses, and 
  gene therapy can help those with terminal illness whose only choice is euthanasia.
  When facing an incurable diseases, birth defects and chronic illnesses wouldn't you
 want a chance to be cured. Gene therapy can help cure many things, it work by replacing 
 mutated genes that cause diseases with a healthy copy of the gene. </p>
        
 <p>Birth defects, uncured chronic illnesses, and terminal illnesses leave 
 people with the sense that euthanasia also referred to as assisted suicide 
 is there only option. "Even where a specific life expectancy (like six months) 
 is referred to, medical experts acknowledge that it is virtually impossible to 
 predict the life expectancy of a particular patient. Some people diagnosed as 
 terminally ill don't die for years, if at all, from the diagnosed condition". 
 This explains how those labeled as uncured  or with a terminal illness have the
 false sense of them dying in a short life span which is not true because you cannot
 predict how long they will live so they choose euthanasia thinking they would die soon.
</p>

<p>Euthanasia is open to people who can easily use gene therapy cure there disease.
"An article in the journal, Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, described assisted suicide 
guidelines for those with a hopeless condition. "Hopeless condition" was defined to include terminal
illness, severe physical or psychological pain, physical or mental debilitation or deterioration, 
or a quality of life that is no longer acceptable to the individual. That means just about anybody 
who has a suicidal impulse". Why would you want to die when you have the possibility to get cured. 
 </p>
        
<p>	As helpful as gene therapy can be it is very expensive for some people. "The smallest 
diseases have more pricing power in the marketplace," he says. "thats usually due to the 
fact that payers donâ€™t have to deal with a lot of patients. Gene therapy being one of the 
best ways to cure disease isn't possible for those who can't afford leaving them with no other
choice then an early death.
 </p>
        
<p> Euthanasia was for terminally ill patients and  those who had excruciating pain now it
is also open to any patients. The problem with this is when they label a patient, terminally
ill it suggest that they will die in a short period of time which causes some patients to 
choose euthanasia  the problem is that this will not always happen patient could die in 10
years or not die until there lifespan ends, so euthanasia should not be used. Also Gene 
therapy helps those with diseases or illnesses. It especially affects those who think they 
don't have another decision besides death and those who might have disabilities in the future.
The whole problem with this is that the people with the most rarest diseases have to pay the most money.
